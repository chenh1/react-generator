WORK IN PROGRESS...

An old generator that I've been experimenting with since 2016. Recently implemented Redux.

Todos:
1. Decouple action/reducer generator
2. Allow options for directory structure

Instructions:
1. Install yeoman:
  `npm install -g yo`

2. Install npm packages:
  `npm install`

3. Run npm link in admin
  `npm link`

4. Scaffold a new project
  `yo react-redux [MyAppName]`

5. Scaffold new features in your app as you build
  `yo react-redux:FeatureTemplate [MyComponentName]`
